I'm Marco Postiglione, a Ph.D. student affiliated with the PicusLab research group at the University of Naples Federico II, under the guidance of Prof. Vincenzo Moscato. 

📚 The title of my Ph.D. thesis is "Knowledge Graphs for Next-Generation Health Science Applications". Here, I've explored challenges related to the extraction of relevant information from the unstructured text in Electronic Health Records, with a particular focus on low-resource languages and few-shot learning scenarios. I've also leveraged Temporal Knowledge Graphs for the prediction of medical adverse events.

🧐 My research interests are in the areas of data-centric AI, knowledge graphs, natural language processing and explainable AI.
