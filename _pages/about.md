I am **Marco Postiglione**, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the [**Northwestern Security & AI Lab**](https://vs-subrahmanian.github.io/) at **Northwestern University**, where I work with [**Prof. V. S. Subrahmanian**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/subrahmanian-vs.html). My research spans **AI security**, **biomedical informatics**, and **trustworthy machine learning**, with a commitment to developing AI systems that advance social good. Much of my current work focuses on building reliable, scalable, and adversary-resilient AI technologies for global media integrity, public safety, and health applications.

At Northwestern, I help lead several large applied-AI initiatives. I deployed the **Global Online Deepfake Detection System ([GODDS](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30398))**, now used by 70+ news organizations and fact-checkers for real-time AI-generated media verification. I also co-developed the **[MNW Benchmark](https://sites.northwestern.edu/nsail/mnw-benchmark-dataset/)** for deepfake detection in partnership with **Microsoft AI for Good Lab** and **WITNESS**, and designed a context-aware audio deepfake detector that substantially improves over state-of-the-art systems under adversarial conditions.

Beyond media forensics, I work on **SMART (Social Movement Analysis & Reasoning Tool)**, built in collaboration with journalists from *The Wall Street Journal*, *The Washington Post*, *The Associated Press*, and others to analyze discourse dynamics and event relationships in social movements such as **#MeToo** and **Black Lives Matter**. I also contribute to national security applications, including **DEWS** (a drone early-warning system deployed with the **Netherlands Police** and **Municipality of The Hague**) and the **Northwestern Terror Early Warning System (NTEWS)**.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering** from the [**University of Naples Federico II**](https://www.unina.it/), advised by **Prof. Vincenzo Moscato**. My doctoral research focused on AI for healthcare, including **few-shot learning for Italian clinical text**, **biomedical NLP**, and **temporal knowledge graph models** for predicting disease progression. As a Visiting PhD Researcher at **King’s College London** in the [Department of Biostatistics & Health Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/biostatistics-health-informatics), I developed a temporal knowledge graph framework integrating clinical histories with medical ontologies to forecast future disorders.
